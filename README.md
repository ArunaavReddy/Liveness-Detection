# Liveness Detection

Most facial recognition algorithms you find on the internet and research papers suffer from photo attacks. These methods work really well at detecting and recognizing faces in images, videos and video streams from webcam. However they canâ€™t distinguish between real life faces and faces in a photo. This inability to recognize faces is due to the fact that these algorithms work on 2D frames.In this project I made an attempt to detect real and fake faces.
